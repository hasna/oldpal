  "subject": "Add Speculation Rules prefetch for dashboard navigation",
  "description": "Introduce a small component or middleware in packages/web to emit Speculation Rules (prefetch) for likely next dashboard routes (e.g., /chat, /sessions, /agents) once authenticated. Keep it conservative (prefetch only, no prerender) and gate behind a config flag to avoid side effects. Add basic tests to ensure rules only render for authenticated pages.",
