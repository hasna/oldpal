  "description": "Bug: stopping the agent while a tool call is running behaves incorrectly (hangs or leaves UI in bad state). Investigate terminal + backend flow when user stops during tool execution: chunk handling, stop signal propagation, and tool cancellation. Add logic so stop cleanly aborts tool call, finalizes response, and resets processing state.",
