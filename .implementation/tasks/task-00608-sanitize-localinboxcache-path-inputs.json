  "description": "packages/core/src/inbox/storage/local-cache.ts uses agentId/emailId/attachment filename directly in join() paths. A malicious ID or filename with '../' or absolute paths can escape the cache dir and overwrite/delete arbitrary files (saveAttachment, saveEmail, cleanup, clear). Validate IDs (safe pattern), sanitize attachment filenames (basename + strip separators), and reject unsafe inputs.",
