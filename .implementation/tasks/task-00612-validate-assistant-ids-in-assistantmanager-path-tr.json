  "description": "Harden packages/core/src/identity/assistant-manager.ts: enforce a safe ID pattern when reading index.json/active.json and when delete/switch/update is called. Ignore or reject IDs with path separators or traversal, and ensure rm/join cannot escape assistants root. Add tests that malicious IDs in index/active are skipped and do not read/write/delete outside base path.",
