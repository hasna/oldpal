  "description": "UI bug: Create API Key dialog keeps showing last created key if closed via overlay/ESC because onOpenChange doesn't clear state. Add onOpenChange handler to reset createdKey/newKeyName/error when closing. Also clear error before fetchKeys so stale errors don't persist after success.",
