  "description": "Bad logic: packages/terminal/package.json now points types to ./src/lib.ts and includes src in files, which breaks published consumer types and bloats package. Restore types to dist output and ensure build generates .d.ts in CI; if monorepo dev needs fallback, use conditional exports or postbuild copy.",
