  "description": "Security/UX: SkillCard/SkillDetailDrawer rely on skill.filePath (absolute server path). Once API stops exposing file paths, update UI to avoid showing filePath; replace with safe source label (shared/project) and optional relative identifier. Update types in packages/web/src/components/skills and handle missing filePath gracefully.",
