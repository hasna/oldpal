  "description": "Bug: terminal UI shows '✻ Worked for 0s' even when response took longer. Investigate packages/terminal/src/components/App.tsx: processingStartTime/processingStartTimeRef handling and finalizeResponse timing. Ensure processingStartTime is set at stream start (including queued/inline) and preserved until finalizeResponse computes elapsed; verify resetTurnState doesn’t clear too early.",
