  "subject": "WS chat: authenticated users can bootstrap sessions",
  "description": "ChatContainer uses WS and generates a client sessionId, but ws.ts now enforces DB session ownership for authenticated users. This breaks WS chat when logged in. Fix by either creating a session via /api/v1/sessions before WS subscribe, or allowing ws.ts to auto-create a session for authenticated users when not found (with safe limits). Add tests for authenticated WS flow.",
