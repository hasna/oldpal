  "description": "App binds Ctrl+S to open SessionSelector, but many terminals treat Ctrl+S as XOFF (freeze output), so the shortcut often fails and can lock the UI. Add an alternative shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+N or F2), and update the UI hint in Status/placeholder. File: packages/terminal/src/components/App.tsx:792-861, Status.tsx:57-89.",
