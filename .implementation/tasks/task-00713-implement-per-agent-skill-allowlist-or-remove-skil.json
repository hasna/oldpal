  "description": "Missing implementation: AgentEditDialog lets users select skills, but backend/core never enforces an allowlist. Either implement allowedSkills in AgentLoop/SkillLoader (filter skill list + skill execution by settings.skills) and wire it from DB agent settings, or remove/disable skills selector until enforcement exists. Add tests.",
