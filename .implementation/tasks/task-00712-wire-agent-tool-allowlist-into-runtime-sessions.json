  "description": "Bug: web agents store settings.tools but runtime never applies them. When creating/starting sessions, fetch agent by session.agentId and pass allowedTools into EmbeddedClient/AgentLoop (agent-pool + session bootstrap). Align naming with core (enabledTools) or map settings.tools to allowedTools. Add tests to confirm tools are restricted per agent.",
