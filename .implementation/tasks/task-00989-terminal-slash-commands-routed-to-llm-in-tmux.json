  "description": "Repro (2026-02-07): In tmux session (2x2 grid, pane D) at repo root, run bun run dev to start terminal app. Clear input (Ctrl+U) and enter /connectors, /messages, /inbox, /hooks, /jobs, /voice, /say hello, /listen. Actual: each command triggers LLM response (Conjuring/Manifesting), with generic text or tool calls (voice_status/voice_listen, ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID error) instead of opening panels or showing built-in command output. Expected: slash commands handled locally (panels for /connectors,/hooks,/messages,/inbox; text for /jobs; voice toggle/say/listen). Note: even /help is routed to LLM.",
