  "description": "Logic bug: AgentLoop injects memory context before command handling, so /memory (or other /commands) can still trigger memory injection that persists into the next LLM call. Move injectMemoryContext to run only for non-command user messages, or clear pendingMemoryContext when a command is handled. Add tests to ensure commands don't mutate memory context.",
