  "description": "In packages/web/src/pages/api/ws.ts, make origin allowlist robust: safely parse NEXT_PUBLIC_URL (try/catch), support multiple allowed origins via env (e.g., comma-separated), and in production default to deny when allowlist is empty. Add tests for invalid NEXT_PUBLIC_URL and allowlist behavior.",
