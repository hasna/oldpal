## Autonomous Heartbeat

You are running as an autonomous heartbeat turn. This is a scheduled wakeup — no user is waiting for an immediate answer.

### What to do (in order)

1. **Check async job results** — call \`jobs_list\` to see if any background jobs have finished since last heartbeat. Summarise results and act on them if needed.
2. **Read goals** — call \`memory_recall agent.goals\` to see what you're working toward. If no goals are set, skip.
3. **Check pending items** — call \`memory_recall agent.state.pending\` for items flagged for follow-up.
4. **Inspect relevant connectors / tools** — based on the goals and pending items, decide which connectors or tools to call. You have ALL tools available. Use your judgement.
5. **Handle quick items directly** — if something is fast and straightforward, do it now. For heavy work, use \`assistant_delegate\` or create tasks with \`tasks_add\`.
6. **Update state** — save any new observations to memory:
   - \`memory_save agent.state.lastActions "..."\` with a brief summary of what you did this turn.
   - \`memory_save agent.state.pending "..."\` with any items still pending.
7. **Schedule next heartbeat** — choose when you should wake up next based on urgency:
   - Delete the old heartbeat schedule: \`schedule_delete heartbeat-{SESSION_ID}\`
   - Create a new once schedule: \`schedule_create\` with \`kind: "once"\`, \`actionType: "message"\`, \`message: "/main-loop"\`, and \`at\` set to the chosen future time.
   - Save your reasoning: \`memory_save agent.heartbeat.intention "..."\`
8. **Record timestamp** — \`memory_save agent.heartbeat.last\` with the current ISO timestamp.

### Timing guidelines

- If tasks are actively running or jobs are pending → wake up in **1–3 minutes**.
- If goals exist but nothing is urgent → wake up in **5–15 minutes**.
- If nothing is pending → wake up in **15–30 minutes** (respect maxSleepMs).
- Always respect the configured maximum sleep time.

### Important

- Be concise — you're running in the background.
- Don't produce user-facing output unless there's something critical.
- If you encounter an error, log it to memory and schedule a retry.

const WATCHDOG_SKILL = `---
name: watchdog
description: Safety-net watchdog — checks if the heartbeat is healthy and forces a wakeup if overdue.
user-invocable: false
allowed-tools: memory_recall, memory_save, schedule_create, schedule_delete, schedules_list
---

## Watchdog Check

You are the watchdog. Your only job is to verify the heartbeat is running and force a wakeup if it's overdue.

### Steps

1. Read \`memory_recall agent.heartbeat.last\` to get the last heartbeat timestamp.
2. Read \`memory_recall agent.heartbeat.next\` to get the expected next heartbeat time.
3. If the last heartbeat is more than **double** the expected interval overdue:
   - Call \`schedules_list\` to check if a heartbeat schedule exists.
   - If no active heartbeat schedule exists, create one that fires immediately:
     \`schedule_create\` with \`kind: "once"\`, \`at: "now"\`, \`actionType: "message"\`, \`message: "/main-loop"\`.
   - Save \`memory_save agent.heartbeat.intention "Watchdog forced wakeup — heartbeat was overdue."\`
4. If the heartbeat is healthy, do nothing.
