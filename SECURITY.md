# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately. Preferred method:

- GitHub Security Advisories: https://github.com/hasna/assistants/security/advisories

If you cannot use GitHub advisories, open a new issue and mark it clearly as **SECURITY** with minimal details, and we will follow up privately.

## Supported Versions

We support the latest released version only. If you are running an older version, please upgrade before reporting.

## Response Expectations

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and provide a status update within 7 business days.
